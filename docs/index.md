Hello, I am Aishwarya Kaura

A creative practitioner crafting experiential spaces in an ephemeral realm - where scale and softness converge, evocative structures and illuminating textures blend, redefining the aura! 
My work traverses luxury, fashion, and culture guided by material sensitivity and passion for exploring sustainable futures in immersive, sensorial scenography.
